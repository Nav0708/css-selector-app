Developed an interactive CSS Selector Randomizer to help users understand and practice CSS specificity.
Built a random selector generator that creates valid CSS selectors with tag names, IDs, classes, pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements, attribute selectors, and combinators.
Implemented a specificity guessing game, providing real-time visual feedback on incorrect guesses.
Enabled interactive explanations for each selector type on hover/click using JavaScript and DOM manipulation.
